## Description

Question Time is a React front end that uses a MongoDB, Express, and Node.js back end that I built for an API project called [pub-quiz](https://github.com/ThwCorbin/pub-quiz "repo on GitHub"). The JSON API I built provides access to trivia questions for a pub quiz game.[1] For the purposes of this project, I will use one trivia category: History. A user will see a history question on page load. The user can answer the question and then see the answer. The user can request another question. The user can change or delete the question. The user can add a question. The user has access to the Pub Quiz API! Scary.

## Features

I developed a bronze/silver/gold plan, which is available in the planning directory in this repo. I am currently working on bronze level features.

## Usage

<!--
Go to http://pub-quiz-game.herokuapp.com/history, which will GET 50 questions in JSON format from the database. See the [API documentation](http://pub-quiz-game.herokuapp.com/doc "Pub Quiz API documentation") for the routes to perform CRUD operations in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/ "A collaboration platform for API development."). -->

<!-- Follow the installation instructions below, `cd` to the pub-quiz directory, and run the following commands in the terminal:

- `node db/seed.js`
- `nodemon index.js`
- note: or `node index.js` if you do not have nodemon installed

Then paste http://localhost:3000/history into your favorite browser. Enjoy the JSON data.

Note: for better viewing pleasure, add an extension to your browser that formats JSON data. For example, the JSON Viewer extension in Chrome is lovely. -->

## Installation

<!-- - Clone the repo: https://github.com/ThwCorbin/pub-quiz
- `cd` to the pub-quiz directory
- run `npm i` in the terminal
- note: you will also need to install mongodb globally -->
