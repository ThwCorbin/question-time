## Features

<!-- I developed a bronze/silver/gold plan, which is available in the planning directory in this repo. I completed all bronze level features. I planned to add more categories of questions (e.g. Mythology, General Knowledge, etc.) in the silver and gold plans, but I've decided that for the purposes of this project (CRUD operations) one category will suffice. I will develop a front end for my next project to work with this back end. -->

## Usage

<!--
Go to http://pub-quiz-game.herokuapp.com/history, which will GET 50 questions in JSON format from the database. See the [API documentation](http://pub-quiz-game.herokuapp.com/doc "Pub Quiz API documentation") for the routes to perform CRUD operations in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/ "A collaboration platform for API development."). -->

<!-- Follow the installation instructions below, `cd` to the pub-quiz directory, and run the following commands in the terminal:

- `node db/seed.js`
- `nodemon index.js`
- note: or `node index.js` if you do not have nodemon installed

Then paste http://localhost:3000/history into your favorite browser. Enjoy the JSON data.

Note: for better viewing pleasure, add an extension to your browser that formats JSON data. For example, the JSON Viewer extension in Chrome is lovely. -->

## Installation

<!-- - Clone the repo: https://github.com/ThwCorbin/pub-quiz
- `cd` to the pub-quiz directory
- run `npm i` in the terminal
- note: you will also need to install mongodb globally -->
